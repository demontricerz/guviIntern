## Problem Statement

Its Becoming the End of the EndGame , Our Superheros were Ending their Mission with End Game with Sacrifice of Mr Tony Stark. During the End Game Captain America's Shield has been Destroyed by Thanos. Mr Peter Parker an Young Scientist Discovered the formula for Vibranium (A Metal Used to Create Cap's Shield). To Create the Shield we Need to Produce Maximum Number of Final <stable> Phase of Vibranium. There will be a wastage of some P Percentage
You will be given Number of Phases of Vibranium N.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
